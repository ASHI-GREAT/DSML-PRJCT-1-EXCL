The  recent bike sales data of K.D Company reveals a positive upswing, driven by several key factors.  Firstly, we're seeing a significant increase in female custmers. This trend is likely due to a growing focus on health and wellness, combined with the diverse range of stylish and functional bikes available for women.

Secondly, a rise in disposable income is fueling purchases across all demographics.  People with more financial resources are finding bikes to be a practical and enjoyable transportation option, particularly in areas with dedicated bike lanes and increasing gas prices.

Finally, there's a correlation between bike sales and homeownership, with residents living near our stores and in neighborhoods with dedicated bike paths showing a strong interest in bike rides. The convenience and potential benefits are likely driving this trend.
